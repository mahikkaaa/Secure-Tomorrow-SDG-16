## Secure Tomorrow's Contribution to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

The Secure Tomorrow project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) - "Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions." SDG 16 aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

The project contributes to SDG 16 by addressing the specific target of ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence against adolescents. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to prevent and combat these forms of violence, thereby promoting a more just and peaceful society.

Furthermore, the project supports the establishment of effective and accountable institutions by developing a robust machine-learning model that can be integrated into existing systems or applications. This model enhances the capability to detect and intervene in instances of abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence, strengthening the institutional response to safeguarding adolescents' rights and well-being.

In summary, the Secure Tomorrow project directly supports SDG 16 by actively working towards the prevention of violence against adolescents and fostering the establishment of strong, accountable institutions that protect the rights and safety of young individuals.

# Secure Tomorrow: Machine Learning Model for Classifying Attempted Suicide Rates Among Adolescents

## Purpose

The primary objective of the Secure Tomorrow project is to leverage the power of machine learning to predict suicide risk among adolescents based on their behavioral patterns and various characteristics. By analyzing the key factors influencing suicide attempts, our aim is to provide valuable insights to mental health professionals, educators, and policymakers, facilitating the design and implementation of targeted prevention strategies and support programs.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning model is an extensive compilation of information from various reputable sources, including global health organizations and research studies. It covers a wide range of behavioral aspects, demographic variables, and suicide-related data, allowing the model to make informed predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Secure Tomorrow project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 
- TensorFlow 
- sci-kit-learn 
- Pandas
- NumPy 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/secure-tomorrow/project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Methodology

The project follows a systematic approach to build and evaluate the machine learning model:

1. Data Collection: Curating a diverse and comprehensive dataset containing information on the 10 core modules related to morbidity and mortality among adolescents.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for analysis to ensure data quality and consistency.

3. Feature Engineering: Identifying relevant features and extracting essential information from the dataset to represent behavioral patterns effectively.

4. Model Selection: Choosing the decision tree classifier due to its interpretability and ability to handle both numeric and categorical data.

5. Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, then training the decision tree classifier on the training data.

6. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. Interpretation: Understanding the decision-making process of the model by visualizing the decision tree and identifying significant factors affecting suicide risk.

## Result

The Secure Tomorrow project aims to achieve accurate predictions of attempted suicide rates among adolescents using the trained decision tree classifier. The model's output will provide a risk score, indicating the likelihood of an adolescent attempting suicide based on their behavioral data. These results can empower mental health professionals and educators with valuable information to identify at-risk individuals and implement timely interventions.

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

   - Acquire the dataset related to abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence against adolescents.
   - Preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and ensure it is in a suitable format for model training.

2. Train the machine learning model:

   - Run the training script, specifying the path to the preprocessed dataset.
   - Select the appropriate algorithm and hyperparameters based on the nature of the problem.

3. Evaluate and fine-tune the model:

   - Use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
   - Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or exploring advanced techniques.

4. Deploy and utilize the model:

   - Integrate the trained model into the desired application or system.
   - Monitor and update the model periodically to ensure its effectiveness and adaptability.
## Future Scope

The Secure Tomorrow project has exciting future possibilities, including:

- Exploring more sophisticated machine learning algorithms or ensemble methods to improve model performance.
- Incorporating additional data sources, such as social media or electronic health records, to enhance predictive capabilities.
- Deploying the model in real-world settings like schools or healthcare centers to support suicide prevention efforts.
