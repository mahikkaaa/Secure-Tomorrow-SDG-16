## Secure Tomorrow's Contribution to SDG 16 : Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions

The Secure Tomorrow project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) - "Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions." SDG 16 aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

The project contributes to SDG 16 by addressing the specific target of ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence against adolescents. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to prevent and combat these forms of violence, thereby promoting a more just and peaceful society.

Furthermore, the project supports the establishment of effective and accountable institutions by developing a robust machine-learning model that can be integrated into existing systems or applications. This model enhances the capability to detect and intervene in instances of abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence, strengthening the institutional response to safeguarding adolescents' rights and well-being.

In summary, the Secure Tomorrow project directly supports SDG 16 by actively working towards the prevention of violence against adolescents and fostering the establishment of strong, accountable institutions that protect the rights and safety of young individuals.

Secure Tomorrow is a machine learning initiative dedicated to contributing to global efforts in ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and all forms of violence against and torture of adolescents. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and techniques, this project aims to create a safer future for young individuals.

## Project Overview

The objective of the Secure Tomorrow project is to develop a robust machine-learning model that can detect, prevent, and combat various forms of abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence targeted at adolescents. This project seeks to provide early intervention, raise awareness, and ultimately contribute to the global mission of eradicating these injustices by analyzing relevant data, identifying patterns, and leveraging advanced algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Secure Tomorrow project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 
- TensorFlow 
- sci-kit-learn 
- Pandas
- NumPy 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare the dataset:

   - Acquire the dataset related to abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and violence against adolescents.
   - Preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and ensure it is in a suitable format for model training.

2. Train the machine learning model:

   - Run the training script, specifying the path to the preprocessed dataset.
   - Select the appropriate algorithm and hyperparameters based on the nature of the problem.

3. Evaluate and fine-tune the model:

   - Use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
   - Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or exploring advanced techniques.

4. Deploy and utilize the model:

   - Integrate the trained model into the desired application or system.
   - Monitor and update the model periodically to ensure its effectiveness and adaptability.
